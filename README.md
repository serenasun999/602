# 601 Project - Working with Data and Visualization
### Guiding Questions
1. How did the environmental parameters such as greenhouse gasses (Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrogen Dioxide and Nitric Oxide), air quality index, wind speed and temperature change over the course of 39 years?
2. Is there any correlation between temperature and greenhouse gasses and between wind speed and greenhouse gasses over the 39 years? 
3. What is the distribution of pollutants throughout Calgary? 


# 602 Project - Statistical Data Analysis
### Focus of statistical investigation
The focus of our statistical investigation is to understand if there is any statistical difference between the particulate matter recorded in Calgary vs particulate matter recorded globally in order to gain evidence to support or reject our hypothesis that PM2.5 globally is equal to PM2.5 in Calgary. We also want to determine how the greenhouse gas emissions changed over the years in Calgary by plotting the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions over the years and estimating the population average via bootstrapping. This data is leveraged by the Government of Alberta to visualize, analyze and continually monitor air pollution. This enables Calgary residents to protect themselves and take the necessary precautions especially those who are health compromised. 

## Dataset
- The dataset we have chosen for our project is “Historical Air Quality”  which was collected by the Calgary Region Airshed Zone and submitted to Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP). This information is publicly available and can be used from the City of Calgary’s Open Data Portal. City of Calgary’s Open Data Portal Historical Air Quality [online].

- WHO Air Quality Database. WHO Air Quality Database (Update 2022), Available at: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database
